# NBA_pair_finder

to use the script that finds pairs of players, execute the python file "nba_main.py" passing it as an argument the number that you want to use as the sum of pairs.


Install the dependencies, for now the only one is numpy

```console
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

example:

```console
$ python nba_main.py 139

-Brevin Knight  Nate Robinson
-Nate Robinson  Mike Wilks
```

You can also run it as linux executable

```console
$ ./nba_main.py 139

-Brevin Knight  Nate Robinson
-Nate Robinson  Mike Wilks
```
